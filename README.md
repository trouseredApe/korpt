# Korpt
Groovy and Grails based project for a non-profit. This project will use crowd-sourced data to catalogue corruption cases. 
korpt, web app is built for AFN, a lean non-profit organization that will start out cataloging corruption cases in Nepal.

# Context
In most of the underdeveloped countries, corruption is a part of life. It is  part of the system people live in. It exists in every facet of society from hospitals, DMVs, police, army, government offices, and even schools. 

Honest people in big government or political organizations have become far and few in between. There are even fewer people in leading positions to make real change in the organization they lead. It is hard for honest people to climb the rank and files in their organization. Any expectation from the leadership to bring about real change is futile. It is not their top priority, and they are comfortable with the status quo.

Corruption has devastating effect on the long term health and progress of a country. One of the areas that bares the brunt of corruption is entrepreneurship. No matter how good of an idea an entrepreneur has, if she has to fight and bribe every step of the way, how can she succeed? 

While it would be nice to wake up one day to a world without corruption, it would not happen unless we act upon it. That day has to come, and we have to bring it on.  With the help of technology, we can slowly head down that path. Think about how people try to solve their personal budget problem: they start writing down the expenses and income; they create categories for the expenses; then they start seeing trends; their biggest expenses etc; and they have a better idea on how to solve their problem. I think we can take this true and tried concept and apply it to corruption. 

The plan is to start collecting data on corruption; then categorizing it based on the department/branches of government or other public facing organization; and  finally analyze and provide reports. These reports would be available via public APIs which other websites, blogs, or organizations can consume and use on their own. Maybe we even convince leading newspaper or television to display corruption reports in a daily or weekly basis. We can do all this while protecting anonymity of victims and accused.

Anonymity is important here because the goal isn’t to go after one individual and create sensational news article, but to gather enough data to define patterns and trends. I strongly believe this is the only way towards a real solutions. Next time when lawmakers and leaders are forced to bring policies and solutions to tackle corruption, we’ll want to be able to measure how effective a certain policy is.

One of the main challenge for this to succeed is data collection. The data has to be crowdsourced for this to succeed. In the beginning, we can mobilize volunteers/employees outside government, and other public facing organization, and collect data from individuals as surveys, but for the long term health of the project, everyday folks will have to enter the data on their own.. We will have to find ways to make reporting corruption easy and satisfying.

The pilot project will be deployed in Nepal, a small country in the foothills of Himalayas. The technology employed for the Website, Reports, and APIs will all be open sourced, so if it succeeds here, it can be easily implemented on the other parts of the world.
